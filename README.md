# Hi, I'm Jewel <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72663882/171687151-bb31c996-c9d2-49c8-b593-734946893b23.gif" alt="Waving hand" width="30"/>

I am pursuing a **Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** degree at **Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University**, where Iâ€™m establishing a strong foundation in software development principles and technologies.

I am an **Aspiring Full Stack Developer** currently learning the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**, with a passion for building **responsive**, **accessible**, and **scalable** web applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.

I am actively enhancing my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** proficiency through consistent practice on **LeetCode**, sharpening my analytical thinking and problem-solving capabilities.

My career goal is to work as a **software engineer** at a leading tech company..InshaAllah.
